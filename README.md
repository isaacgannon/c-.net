This project was designed to simplify the user's experience in deciding what they would want for dinner and to assist them with their process of shopping for groceries by giving them a list of suggested ingredients for them to then decide what they would want to eat. This project was made with C# on the .net framework on the VS code to work as simple. When designing this application, we looked into the content style we wanted to work with a more laid back and casual interaction with the user. We also want the application to be simple and with few applications that allow for any user to understand without previous knowledge or any advanced computer literacy. We tried to make all the text boxes and button sizes uniform to make the app feel continuous and will be able to make a uniform feeling with the user.
